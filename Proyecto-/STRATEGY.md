# Project Strategy: CRM Automation

## 1. Current Goal and Status

Our primary objective is to build a robust, end-to-end CRM automation workflow. We have successfully completed the initial phases, including lead validation and mock AI ad generation.

We are currently in **Phase 3: CRM Integration**. However, direct integration with the HighLevel API is **currently blocked**. This is because the available HighLevel account is a free/trial version, which does not grant the necessary API access to create private applications and generate authentication tokens.

## 2. The Strategic Pivot: Mock Integration

To ensure the project continues to advance despite the external limitation, we have implemented a strategic pivot:

**We are proceeding with a Mock HighLevel Integration.**

This involves using a new workflow, `crm-lead-workflow-phase3-mock.json`, which perfectly simulates the responses of the real HighLevel API. This strategy allows us to:

-   **Test the Full Workflow**: We can validate the entire end-to-end logic, from webhook trigger to final response, without needing real credentials.
-   **Maintain Project Momentum**: Development is not halted while waiting for an account upgrade.
-   **Be Ready for Production**: The workflow is designed to be a "plug-and-play" system. Once API access is available, the mock node can be easily swapped with the real HighLevel nodes.

## 3. How This Strategy Connects Our Documentation

This section explains how to navigate the project's documentation in the context of our current strategy.

-   **`FIRST_STEPS.md`**
    -   **Purpose**: The starting point for any new team member.
    -   **Relation**: It introduces the project's high-level **architectural vision** (the hybrid n8n + Python model). You should read this file first to understand our goals.

-   **`STRATEGY.md` (This Document)**
    -   **Purpose**: Explains the *current, practical plan* of action.
    -   **Relation**: This document details the **mock integration workaround** and clarifies which parts of the project are active and which are on hold. It connects the vision from `FIRST_STEPS.md` to our day-to-day work.

-   **`PYTHON_INCLUSION.md`**
    -   **Purpose**: Details the rationale and long-term roadmap for our hybrid n8n + Python architecture.
    -   **Relation**: This document describes the **future-state** we are building towards. Our first planned Python component, the `highlevel_token_manager.py` script, is currently on hold because it depends on the real HighLevel API.

-   **`HIGHLEVEL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`** & **`HIGHLEVEL_AUTH_TOKEN_GUIDE.md`**
    -   **Purpose**: These guides contain the technical instructions for connecting to the **real** HighLevel API.
    -   **Relation**: Due to the account limitations, these documents are currently **ON HOLD**. They are preserved for the future, when a full HighLevel subscription is available.

## 4. The Path Forward

Our immediate plan is clear and actionable:

1.  **Test the Mock Workflow**: The immediate next step is to import and test the `crm-lead-workflow-phase3-mock.json` file to confirm our entire business logic is sound.
2.  **Proceed with Python Development (Optional)**: We can begin developing other Python microservices for tasks that don't depend on the HighLevel API, such as more advanced AI text generation or lead scoring logic.
3.  **Await HighLevel Access**: Once a full HighLevel account is available, we will execute the plan detailed in the `HIGHLEVEL_AUTH_TOKEN_GUIDE.md` and `HIGHLEVEL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` to switch from the mock to the real integration.
